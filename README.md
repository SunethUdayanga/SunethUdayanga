### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Suneth Udayanga and I am currently an undergraduate student. 
I am also a qualified ICT Technician with over a year of work experience in the IT field. 
My technical skills and hands-on experience in the industry have helped me develop a strong foundation in the latest technologies and a keen eye for detail. 
I am passionate about using technology to solve problems and improve processes, 
  and I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges. 
When I am not working or studying, 
  I enjoy exploring new software and hardware, 
  and finding creative ways to use technology in my everyday life.
